Generate complex ASCII art of a dragon. 
Ensure it is well-formatted and symmetrical. 
It should fit reasonably well within a vertical column layout and not overflow horizontally. 
Use only standard ASCII characters. Only return the ascii art and no other context or messages.
Make it detailed and visually impressive.
