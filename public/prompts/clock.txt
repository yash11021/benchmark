Write a single-file HTML/CSS/JS solution that renders a functional, 
aesthetic analog clock. 
It must be responsive and automatically scale to fit the center of its 
container without scrollbars. Use a dark theme. 
The clock should show hour, minute, and second hands. 
Include subtle animations and clean styling.
